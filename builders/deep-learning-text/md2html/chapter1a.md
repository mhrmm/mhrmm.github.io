# variables

Variables are such a central part of a mathematics education that one might wonder: why even bother reviewing them? But deep neural networks conscript so many variables into service that it helps to have formalisms for keeping them straight. 

A **variable** is a symbol associated with a **domain** of possible values. We will usually use capital (English and Greek) letters to represent variables, and we will assume that we can apply a global function $\Delta$ to any variable to obtain its domain.  Domains can be **discrete** (a "countable" set of distinct values, which can be **finite** or **infinite**) or **continuous** (like the set $\mathbb{R}$ of all real numbers), depending on our needs. 

![Examples of variables](boards/board-vars1.png)

@eg[
    To represent the current season, we could use a variable $S$ with the **finite discrete** domain:  
    @eq[ 
        \Delta(S) = \lbrace \texttt{winter}, \texttt{spring}, \texttt{summer}, \texttt{autumn} \rbrace 
    @eq] 
    To represent the current year, we could use a variable $Y$ with the **infinite discrete** domain: 
    @eq[ 
        \Delta(Y) = \lbrace \ldots, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, \ldots \rbrace 
    @eq] 
    To represent the current outdoor temperature, we could use a variable $T$ with **continuous** domain: 
    @eq[ 
        \Delta(T) = \mathbb{R} 
    @eq] 
@eg]

One important discrete domain is the **binary domain** $\lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace$. A variable $X$ with domain $\lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace$ is referred to as a **binary variable**. Binary variables are often interpreted as **booleans**, where the value $1$ corresponds to **true** and the value $0$ corresponds to **false**. 	

In deep learning, variables are often collected together into **sets**, and it helps to have notation for dealing with these variable sets. As with variables, we will usually use capital letters to refer to a variable set, but will often add subscripts to distinguish the components, e.g. 

@eq[X = \lbrace X_1, \dots, X_n \rbrace @eq]

We can extend the idea of the **value of a variable** (e.g. "winter" is a value of variable $S$ that we defined above) to the **value of a variable set**, which we will call an **event**.

[[Define an **event** of variable set $X=\lbrace X_1, \dots, X_n \rbrace $ as a function that maps each variable in set $X$ to a value in its domain $\Delta(X)$.]]

@eg[ 
    Assume $S$ and $Y$ are the example variables defined above. For variable set $V= \lbrace S, Y \rbrace$ , one event is:
    @eq[ 
        \lbrace S \mapsto \texttt{summer}, Y \mapsto 1969 \rbrace 
    @eq] 
    If you're unfamiliar with this way of representing a function, it says: $S$ maps to "summer" and $Y$ maps to 1969.  
@eg]

To refer to an event, we will usually use the **lowercase** version of the letter that represents its variable set. For instance, we would use $x$ to refer to an event of variable set $X$. Because an event $x$ of variable set

@eq[ 
    X= \lbrace X_1, \dots, X_n \rbrace 
@eq]

is a **function**, we can refer to the value of a particular variable $X_i \in X$ using this notation:

@eq[ x(X_i) @eq]

@eg[ 
    Consider the event: 
    @eq[ 
        v= \lbrace S \mapsto \texttt{summer}, Y \mapsto 1969 \rbrace 
    @eq]
    Then $v(S)= \texttt{summer}$ and $v(Y)=1969$. 
@eg]

It will sometimes be convenient to have a more compact notation for events.  To refer to an arbitrary event @eq[ \lbrace X_1 \mapsto x_1, X_2 \mapsto x_2, \dots , X_n \mapsto x_n \rbrace @eq] of a variable set $\lbrace X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \rbrace$, we will sometimes just use the concatenation $x_1x_2...x_n$. Similarly, given two events $v \in \Delta(V)$,  $w \in \Delta(W)$ of disjoint variable sets $V$ and $W$, we will use the concatenation $vw$ to refer to the union $v \cup w$ of the events.

@eg[ 
    In a proof, we might state: "Let $sy$ be an event of variable set $\lbrace S, Y\rbrace $."  In this context, $sy$ is a shorthand for: 
    @eq[ 
        \lbrace S \mapsto s, Y \mapsto y\rbrace 
    @eq]
@eg]

Finally, define the **domain** $\Delta(X)$ of variable set $X=\lbrace X_1, \dots, X_n \rbrace$ as the set of all possible events of $X$.

@eg[ 
    Domain $\Delta({S, Y})$ contains the following events (among infinitely many others): 
    @eq[ 
        \lbrace S \mapsto \texttt{summer}, Y \mapsto 1969 \rbrace
    @eq] 
    @eq[ 
        \lbrace S \mapsto \texttt{winter}, Y \mapsto 1709 \rbrace
    @eq] 
    @eq[ 
        \lbrace S \mapsto \texttt{spring}, Y \mapsto 2020 \rbrace
    @eq]

# vectors

A **vector** is an array of numbers, which we will represent like this:

@eq[
    \begin{pmatrix} 1.5\\ -2 \\ 50 \end{pmatrix}
@eq]

We will adopt the convention of using parentheses (as above) to denote vectors. When using a variable to represent a vector, we will typically use upper-case letters, e.g.:

@eq[
    A = \begin{pmatrix} 1.5\\ -2 \\ 50 \end{pmatrix}
@eq]

Moreover, we can use variables to represent individual elements of the vector. Typically this is done using subscripts, e.g.:

@eq[
    A =  \begin{pmatrix} A_1\\ A_2 \\ A_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1.5\\ -2 \\ 50 \end{pmatrix}
@eq]

The number of elements in a vector is referred to as the **length** of the vector. For instance, the above example has length 3.

In deep learning, vectors are used extensively to organize related quantities. We will often use them to compute **weighted sums** using the **dot product** operator. 


@focus[
    Let $A =  \begin{pmatrix} A_1\\ \vdots \\ A_n \end{pmatrix}$ and 
    $B =  \begin{pmatrix} B_1\\ \vdots \\ B_n \end{pmatrix}$ be vectors of length $n$. The **dot product** operator is defined:
    @eq[
    A \cdot B
    =
    A_1 B_1 + \dots + A_n B_n
    @eq]
@focus][Definition]

@focus[
    For instance, suppose you taking a course whose grade breakdown was 20% homework, 30% midterm, and 50% final exam. If your homework score was 90/100, your midterm score was 80/100, and your final exam score was 70/100, then your overall score would be the following weighted sum:
    @eq[
        .20 \times 90 + .30 \times 80 + .50 \times 70 = 77
    @eq]
    Another way to express this weighted sum is to collect the percentages and the scores into two separate vectors:
    @eq[
        A =  \begin{pmatrix} .20\\ .30\\ .50 \end{pmatrix} 
        \mbox{ and }
        B =  \begin{pmatrix} 90\\ 80\\ 70 \end{pmatrix} 
    @eq]
    Then the weighted sum can be expressed using the **dot product** operator:
    @eq[
        A \cdot B
        =
        \begin{pmatrix} .20\\ .30\\ .50 \end{pmatrix} 
        \cdot
        \begin{pmatrix} 90\\ 80\\ 70 \end{pmatrix} 
        =
        .20 \times 90 + .30 \times 80 + .50 \times 70 
        = 77
    @eq]
@focus][Example]

# matrices

Sometimes we need to compute lots of similar weighted sums. Imagine that we didn't just want to compute the final grade of one student, but rather the final grades of several students.

Here's how each student performed in the course:

![Course grades](boards/board-matrices1.jpg)

As before, the course has the following grade breakdown:

- 20% homework
- 30% midterm
- 50% final exam

But there's also an alternative grade breakdown for students who perform better on the final exam than on the midterm. In that case, they can opt for the following grade breakdown:

- 20% homework
- 0% midterm
- 80% final exam

Each student's final grade according to each grade breakdown can be calculated by computing six similar dot products:

![Final grade computation](boards/board-matrices2.jpg)

For instance, the top-left box computes the final grade of the first student according to the first grade breakdown:

@eq[
    \begin{pmatrix} .2\\ .3\\ .5 \end{pmatrix} 
        \cdot
        \begin{pmatrix} 80\\ 95\\ 90 \end{pmatrix} 
        =
        .2 \times 80 + .3 \times 95 + .5 \times 90 
        = 89.5
@eq]

We can express the above grid of computations more compactly by flipping the grade breakdown vectors on their side and performing a **matrix multiplication**:

![Final grade computation as matrix multiplication](boards/board-matrices3.jpg)

This is a general technique that will be central to our study of deep learning, so let's formalize these ideas.

@focus[
    A **matrix** is a two-dimensional array of numbers. 
@focus][Definition]

@focus[
    The matrices from our grade breakdown example can be defined:
    @eq[
        A = \begin{bmatrix} .2 & .3 & .5 \\ .2 & 0 & .8 \end{bmatrix} 
    @eq]
    @eq[
        B = \begin{bmatrix} 80 & 90 & 96 \\ 95 & 80 & 90 \\ 90 & 70 & 92 \end{bmatrix} 
    @eq]
    Since matrix $A$ has 2 rows and 3 columns, it can be referred to as a $2\times 3$ matrix, or we can say that it has **shape** $(2,3)$. We will adopt the convention of using square brackets (as above) to denote matrices.
@focus][Example]

    @popquizitem[
        @q[
            What is the shape of matrix $B$?
        @q]
        @a[
            Since matrix $B$ has 3 rows and 3 columns, it is a 3x3 matrix. In other words, it has shape $(3,3)$.

We can refer to individual elements, row, and columns of a matrix using subscripts:
- $X_{ij}$ refers to the **element** of matrix $X$ at row $i$ and column $j$. 
- $X_{i\star}$ refers to the $i$th **row** of matrix $X$, expressed as a vector.
- $X_{\star j}$ refers to the $j$th **column** of matrix $X$, expressed as a vector.
