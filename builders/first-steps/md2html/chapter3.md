# arithmetic expressions

Arithmetic expressions are common in Python.

@pye! (5+6) * (7+8) @bye!

Here is an example of an arithmetic expression in Python, and its corresponding expression tree.

@py! (5+6) * (7+8) @by!

Notice that you can expand and collapse the nodes of the above tree.
And we can do this:

@py! pow(1, pow(pow(pow(3, 3), 3), 3)) @by!

And this:

@py! min(len("seven"), len("seventy")) @by!
